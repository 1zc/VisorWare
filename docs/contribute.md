### contribute.md || Contributing to the VisorWare Project

##### **This document is marked incomplete and may be missing information.**

Contributions to the VisorWare project are always welcome, no matter how big or small! As I am a solo developer, it is very difficult for me to find time to work on this project and regularly pump out updates. Contributing to the project greatly helps keep VisorWare growing.

## Making and Proposing Modifications/Features

Feel free to fork the repository if you'd like to develop/make changes to the source code! You can then file a pull request to be reviewed and then added to the main source in a build update release.

When filing a pull request, it is important to clearly specify what changes you have introduced. Please include a brief summary/change-log to help me understand and review your code faster! There is no limit to how long the summary can be, but please ensure it is clear at explaining your changes.

Any suggestions, bug fixes, feature proposals, performance enhancements, and **ANY** miscellaneous changes are welcome! Nothing is considered bad/useless, so please do not hesistate to put your thoughts forward. Although I try my best, pull requests can take time to be reviewed as I might be caught up with life and other things - you can always approach me via email or reddit if you'd like to get in touch!

## Contributors Bounty Board

I have set up a Contributors Bounty Board to show what VisorWare needs and the priority. This can give direction to start with when first contributing. 

The board lists general things that need attention for continued development - including bugs, wanted features, functionality reworks, etc.

You can find the board by [clicking here](https://github.com/1zc/VisorWare/projects/2) or by navigating to [the repository](https://github.com/1zc/VisorWare), clicking the "PROJECTS" tab and entering the Contributors Bounty Board.
